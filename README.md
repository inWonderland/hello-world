Overview of study accomplishments so far

1. Let's not be rude and introduce myself first. Marloes here, mom of two, married to awsome musician, together it's a family with a travel bug gene. So chaos and discovery rule the household.

2. All software as described is installed and working.

3. User Experience: read and downloaded the file. Question I would have: Do I understand it correctly if it was to be a combination of evernote and pinterest?

4. Patterns from the surveys:
    - Browsing is primarily on mobile devices and not on desktop or smart tvs
    - People save content a lot and they do that by bookmarking or pinterest.
    - They like speed, accessibility, ease of use
    - Currently they are lacking overview, user interface they like, and compatibility with all devices
    - Note taking is done primarily on their smart phone using the notes app on it
    - They like that it will not get lost and they can access it easily
    - They miss being able to cross it off (sense of accomplishment), categorising / creating overview and a good search function
    - If they use social to sign in (half of respondents) they do it because it saves time
    
    SWOT Evernote
    strengths: strong market position in certain fields and regions, references to using post its and notebooks which is well known behaviour, supports handwritten notes,quick link to share, clipping tool in the browser
    weaknesses: limited experience in the free subscription, accessibility, organising within the mobile app, need data connection to access,
    
    SWOT Pinterest
    strengths: pictures are eye catching, refers to offline behaviour: making a pin board, has a function similar to putting something in your favourites which is dominant behaviour, integration of the plugin on lots of ecommerce / news websites / blogs, quick link to share
    weaknesses: considered more for women than for men, timelime can be overflooded with pins not relevant for that person, 
    opportunities: links to websites so is a traffic builder which will encourage sites to use the plugin
    threats: pins that are spam and detoriate the quality of pins, youth seems to go for other options (unknown to me which apps they use)
    
    SWOT Onenote
    strengths: looks like a paper note book, access without a data connection, interacts easily with Office
    waeknesses: better on windows than on mac, mobile interface and features less than competition
    
    Opportunity for all: growing cloud computing, getting customed to use of apps
    Threats for all: rapid tech changes, ease of copying product and product features
