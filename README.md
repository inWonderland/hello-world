Overview of study accomplishments so far

1. Let's not be rude and introduce myself first. Marloes here, mom of two, married to awsome musician, together it's a family with a travel bug gene. So chaos and discovery rule the household.

2. All software as described is installed and working.

3. User Experience: read and downloaded the file. Question I would have: Do I understand it correctly if it was to be a combination of evernote and pinterest?

4. Patterns from the surveys:
    - Browsing is primarily on mobile devices and not on desktop or smart tvs
    - People save content a lot and they do that by bookmarking or pinterest.
    - They like speed, accessibility, ease of use
    - Currently they are lacking overview, user interface they like, and compatibility with all devices
    - Note taking is done primarily on their smart phone using the notes app on it
    - They like that it will not get lost and they can access it easily
    - They miss being able to cross it off (sense of accomplishment), categorising / creating overview and a good search function
    - If they use social to sign in (half of respondents) they do it because it saves time
    
    SWOT Evernote
    strengths: strong market position in certain fields and regions, references to using post its and notebooks which is well known behaviour, supports handwritten notes,quick link to share, clipping tool in the browser
    weaknesses: limited experience in the free subscription, accessibility, organising within the mobile app, need data connection to access,
    
    SWOT Pinterest
    strengths: pictures are eye catching, refers to offline behaviour: making a pin board, has a function similar to putting something in your favourites which is dominant behaviour, integration of the plugin on lots of ecommerce / news websites / blogs, quick link to share
    weaknesses: considered more for women than for men, timelime can be overflooded with pins not relevant for that person, 
    opportunities: links to websites so is a traffic builder which will encourage sites to use the plugin
    threats: pins that are spam and detoriate the quality of pins, youth seems to go for other options (unknown to me which apps they use)
    
    SWOT Onenote
    strengths: looks like a paper note book, access without a data connection, interacts easily with Office
    waeknesses: better on windows than on mac, mobile interface and features less than competition
    
    Opportunity for all: growing cloud computing, getting customed to use of apps
    Threats for all: rapid tech changes, ease of copying product and product features
 
 Assignment 5: Created three persona's
 There is a pattern to be seen with the persona's already given. Feels a bit dawnting at the moment to try to create something that will fit all the persona's. Maybe need to choose a, forgive the marketing term, "target group"?
 Persona's are to be found in my dropbox folder named Blocbox.
 
 Assignment 6: Made user flows blocbox
 Shared the spreadsheet with user stories via email. This is the link to the user flows https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwnS7DNSveYlYUkwRGtBOURzZ28/view?usp=sharing
 
 Assignment 7: Sitemap
 Sitemap using draw: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwnS7DNSveYlU1dpUmFZWFJTdVk/view?usp=sharing
 Sitemap using Balsamiq: is in myBalsamiq folder which you have access to
 
 Content for the contributors page
    - To add collaborators, a user will need to input an e-mail address of the recipient. We should also provide a message sent with the invitation. We should provide a pre-existing message that is sent, allowing the user to write their own.
 User can also try putting a name in. If the name already exists in Blocbox they can simply click to add.
    - The users also need to manage their collaborators. Each collaborator should be listed with their name and e-mail, providing the user with the option to remove.
    - Per contributor it shows in which of your group blocbox(es) they are contributing and their latest contribution
    
 Assignment 8: Homepage mockup
 - All mockups are in my balsamiq file
 - Versions 1 to 3 are according to assignment. Versions 4 to 7 are own variations. Like version 4 the most for now.
 - As you can may be read in the mockups 4 to 7, changed the assignment a bit to a platform devoted to professional musicians
 - Looked at other homepages and primarily noted two things. First: the length of the homepage. Apparently scrolling has replaced clicking. Second: Pricing plans are burried further in the interaction when services also have a free plan.
 
Assignment 9: Dashboard and account wireframes
- All in mybalsamiq file. All according to assignment, so not yet turned into specific for music yet. Will do that in high fidelity wireframing.

Assignment 10: Typefaces
- Ai and pdf files are in my dropbox folder called Blocbox. V1 is according to assignment.
- For version 2 I chose a more street and outspoken typeface for the heading to match with the targeted industry (music). Bungee refers a bit to old school graffiti in my opinion. So it is a bit retro, but in a modern way. Design wise I like you can use it vertically very well as well. Which gives more options for headers. I paired it with Open Sans Regular. Thought it needed a very neutral font to contrast with the very outspoken font. Open Sans Light doesn't give enough counterbalance and Open Sans semi-bold makes everything bit too heavy. Both are sans serif typefaces.
- For version 3 I chose a serif font that has a handwriting feel to it. In this way it refers to capturing notes. I paired it with Lato light, to keep the lightness and again contrast something outspoken with something far more basic.
- At the moment slight preference towards version 2 but in doubt between all three versions. So wondering what you think.
