Overview of study accomplishments so far

1. Let's not be rude and introduce myself first. Marloes here, mom of two, married to awsome musician, together it's a family with a travel bug gene. So chaos and discovery rule the household.

2. All software as described is installed and working.

3. User Experience: read and downloaded the file. Question I would have: Do I understand it correctly if it was to be a combination of evernote and pinterest?

4. Patterns from the surveys:
    - Browsing is primarily on mobile devices and not on desktop or smart tvs
    - People save content a lot and they do that by bookmarking or pinterest.
    - They like speed, accessibility, ease of use
    - Currently they are lacking overview, user interface they like, and compatibility with all devices
    - Note taking is done primarily on their smart phone using the notes app on it
    - They like that it will not get lost and they can access it easily
    - They miss being able to cross it off (sense of accomplishment), categorising / creating overview and a good search function
    - If they use social to sign in (half of respondents) they do it because it saves time
    
    SWOT Evernote
    strengths: strong market position in certain fields and regions, references to using post its and notebooks which is well known behaviour, supports handwritten notes,quick link to share, clipping tool in the browser
    weaknesses: limited experience in the free subscription, accessibility, organising within the mobile app, need data connection to access,
    
    SWOT Pinterest
    strengths: pictures are eye catching, refers to offline behaviour: making a pin board, has a function similar to putting something in your favourites which is dominant behaviour, integration of the plugin on lots of ecommerce / news websites / blogs, quick link to share
    weaknesses: considered more for women than for men, timelime can be overflooded with pins not relevant for that person, 
    opportunities: links to websites so is a traffic builder which will encourage sites to use the plugin
    threats: pins that are spam and detoriate the quality of pins, youth seems to go for other options (unknown to me which apps they use)
    
    SWOT Onenote
    strengths: looks like a paper note book, access without a data connection, interacts easily with Office
    waeknesses: better on windows than on mac, mobile interface and features less than competition
    
    Opportunity for all: growing cloud computing, getting customed to use of apps
    Threats for all: rapid tech changes, ease of copying product and product features
 
 Assignment 5: Created three persona's
 There is a pattern to be seen with the persona's already given. Feels a bit dawnting at the moment to try to create something that will fit all the persona's. Maybe need to choose a, forgive the marketing term, "target group"?
 Persona's are to be found in my dropbox folder named Blocbox.
 
 Assignment 6: Made user flows blocbox
 Shared the spreadsheet with user stories via email. This is the link to the user flows https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwnS7DNSveYlYUkwRGtBOURzZ28/view?usp=sharing
 
 Assignment 7: Sitemap
 Sitemap using draw: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwnS7DNSveYlU1dpUmFZWFJTdVk/view?usp=sharing
 Sitemap using Balsamiq: is in myBalsamiq folder which you have access to
 
 Content for the contributors page
    - To add collaborators, a user will need to input an e-mail address of the recipient. We should also provide a message sent with the invitation. We should provide a pre-existing message that is sent, allowing the user to write their own.
 User can also try putting a name in. If the name already exists in Blocbox they can simply click to add.
    - The users also need to manage their collaborators. Each collaborator should be listed with their name and e-mail, providing the user with the option to remove.
    - Per contributor it shows in which of your group blocbox(es) they are contributing and their latest contribution
    
 Assignment 8: Homepage mockup
 - All mockups are in my balsamiq file
 - Versions 1 to 3 are according to assignment. Versions 4 to 7 are own variations. Like version 4 the most for now.
 - As you can may be read in the mockups 4 to 7, changed the assignment a bit to a platform devoted to professional musicians
 - Looked at other homepages and primarily noted two things. First: the length of the homepage. Apparently scrolling has replaced clicking. Second: Pricing plans are burried further in the interaction when services also have a free plan.
 
Assignment 9: Dashboard and account wireframes
- All in mybalsamiq file. All according to assignment, so not yet turned into specific for music yet. Will do that in high fidelity wireframing.

Assignment 10: Typefaces
- Ai and pdf files are in my dropbox folder called Blocbox. V1 is according to assignment.
- For version 2 I chose a more street and outspoken typeface for the heading to match with the targeted industry (music). Bungee refers a bit to old school graffiti in my opinion. So it is a bit retro, but in a modern way. Design wise I like you can use it vertically very well as well. Which gives more options for headers. I paired it with Open Sans Regular. Thought it needed a very neutral font to contrast with the very outspoken font. Open Sans Light doesn't give enough counterbalance and Open Sans semi-bold makes everything bit too heavy. Both are sans serif typefaces.
- For version 3 I chose a serif font that has a handwriting feel to it. In this way it refers to capturing notes. I paired it with Lato light, to keep the lightness and again contrast something outspoken with something far more basic.
- At the moment slight preference towards version 2 but in doubt between all three versions. So wondering what you think.
- As a reminder: dropbox link is https://www.dropbox.com/sh/46zyvh4ygvx6571/AAD8UIEo6PByhvZU1EQkMABFa?dl=0

Assignment 11: Logo's
- Ai and pdf files are in my dropbox folder called Blocbox.
- Logoblocbox v1 is according to assignment.
- Logoblocbox studies is a selection of my brainstorm. Tried to do something with the music target group, the font and a neon version (wich the inline version of the font reminded me of).
- Worked on two in logo blocbox v2 and v3.

Assignment 12: Color pallette
- Ai and pdf files are in my dropbox folder called Blocbox. Now also including the monochromatic and complementary schemes.
- Type face and color to assignment. Selected the retro feel logo based on feedback by musicians. Used the color pallette that the font designer uses as well on the font website. Work really well for the retro feel I think.
- My end choice is my own designed logo and color palette. It matches the current design esthetic (retro) prevalent in the music industry (see Marshall, guitar brands, drum brands, tv shows, etc).

Assignment 13: High fidelity homepage
- Page according to instruction video and alternative home page are in dropbox file named high fidelity.

Assignment 14: High fidelity sign up / sign in
- Are in the same file as mentioned above

Assignment 15: High fidelity dashboard 
- Are in the same .ai and pdf file
- Dit not change it to own ideas yet (music, font, etc) and incorporating feedback. Thinking of doing that all at once in the end of the high fidelity wireframing.
- Pros and cons for horizontal navigation:
    - Pros: You can lock the horizontal navigation so you will not need to scroll up for the menu if you have a lot of content
    - Cons: Glancing may not be easy (see pros vertical), with a lot of boxes the navigation can get cluttered easily
- Pros and cons for vertical navigation:
    - Pros: Everything is in a list form making it easier to scan, other popular websites use same navigation so people get accustomed.
    - Cons: Takes up a lot of space in comparison to users own content, if list of boxes gets long people will need to scroll often

Assignment 16:
- Same .ai and .pdf file
- Included screen without billing address. You can get by with credit card details on its own. Include just the zippcode to surpress fraude options. 

Assignment 17:
- Same .ai and .pdf file
- Made three artboards for menus per category to be able to edit.

Assignment 18:
- Invited you to the invision environment for this project
- Decided not to further explore the music version due to time constraints.

Assignment 19:
- Did the interview and the online test
- Most heard is that the would like a top menu on the home page. My assumption is that due to the image size and placement, the description of the product is beneath the fold and people start to search. Maybe if we integrate the headline and the image, the three icons and their text appear above the fold and things become clearer on the home page.

Assignment 20:
- PSD files dashboardbb, dashboardbbdiffcolour and dashboardblankstate are in my blocbox folder.

Assignment 21:
- All Sketch files are in the dropbox folder.

Assignment 22:
- All PSD and Sketch files are in the dropbox folder.
- The error screens are only made in PSD

Assignment 23
- See all PSD and Sketch files in the dropbox folder
- Bit unsure about the input feedback
